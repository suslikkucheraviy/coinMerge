- Django also manages the memory of the game, including user data and scores.
- The project includes an admin panel powered by Django, allowing administrators to manage various aspects of the game.

#### HTML/JavaScript
- The game's user interface is built using HTML and JavaScript, providing an interactive and engaging experience for players.
- The use of HTML and JavaScript allows for the efficient loading of game resources on demand, reducing initial loading times and improving overall performance.
- The physics of the game are managed using the matter-js library, which provides a powerful physics engine for realistic object interactions and movements. The matter-js library can be found at https://github.com/liabru/matter-js.
